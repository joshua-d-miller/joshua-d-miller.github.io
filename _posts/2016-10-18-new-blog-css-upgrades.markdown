Once again, thanks to my work colleague [Nick Kline](https://github.com/ndkline "Nick's GitHub"), I have been able to make some additional modifications to really make this new blog site shine. I'm really starting to like the way I can easily publish blog posts and how great the site looks. Some of the new features I was able to add were as follows:

- Ability to Search the website using the wonderful plugin [Simple Jekyll Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search "Simple Jekyll Search")
- CSS enhancements to make the buttons pretty
- Modifications to the base CSS of this theme in order to fully utilize Markdown
- Sharing buttons at the bottom of each post<br/><br/>

Unfortunately I'm still working through Facebook's sharing mechanism but I am very optimistic that this will soon be resolved. Now to begin the brain dump...
