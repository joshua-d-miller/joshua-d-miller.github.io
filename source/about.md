I am currently a Systems Administrator for the College of Education at The Pennsylvania State University. I currently support 450+ macOS devices, 150+ iOS devices and a few Linux Servers. I am also backup to our Windows Systems Administrator.

I am very interested in using Python when it comes to developing a method to deploy software as well as a new found interest in utilizing Objective C to make macOS changes. (Also do this in Python)
